be a purpose of existence of every group. Group members identify the purpose of the group

Groups in life skills offer a unique opportunity for individuals to receive feedback and constructive
criticism from peers, mentors, and facilitators. This feedback loop fosters self-awareness and
encourages continuous improvement, as members reflect on their actions, behaviors, and decisions
within the group context. Additionally, groups provide a sense of accountability, as members commit
to their personal growth journey and support each other in achieving their goals. This collective
accountability motivates individuals to stay focused and committed to their development, even when
faced with obstacles or setbacks. Ultimately, groups serve as catalysts for transformative learning
experiences, empowering individuals to unleash their full potential and thrive in both their personal
and professional lives.

After reaching the performing stage, groups may enter a final phase known as adjourning or
mourning, depending on the nature of the group and its objectives. In this stage, the group disbands
either temporarily or permanently, often following the completion of its goals or the end of a specific
project. During adjourning, members may experience a range of emotions, including satisfaction with
their accomplishments, nostalgia for the bonds formed within the group, and uncertainty about the
future. It's a time for reflection on the group's successes and challenges, as well as an opportunity to
celebrate achievements and express gratitude for the contributions of each member. While adjourning
marks the end of the group's formal existence, the connections and experiences forged during its
duration can endure, serving as a foundation for future collaborations and friendships.


heading:Importance of group
Groups are essential in life, offering a wealth of benefits for personal, social, and professional growth.
They create a sense of belonging and community, addressing fundamental human needs for
connection and support. By fostering relationships and alleviating loneliness, groups contribute to
mental and emotional well-being. Moreover, they serve as fertile ground for learning and skill
development, enabling the exchange of knowledge and experiences among members. Through
collaboration, individuals refine their communication, teamwork, and leadership skills, equipping them
for success in various spheres of life. Additionally, groups encourage diversity and perspective-taking,
exposing individuals to different cultures and viewpoints, fostering empathy and broadening horizons.
