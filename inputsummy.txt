Groups play a vital role in life skills development, offering a platform for individuals to interact, learn, and grow together. In the realm of life skills, groups provide a supportive environment where members can share experiences, insights, and strategies for personal and professional development. Through group activities, individuals cultivate essential skills such as communication, collaboration, leadership, and empathy. These settings offer diverse perspectives and challenges, encouraging members to broaden their horizons and adapt to different situations.

Additionally, groups provide a sense of accountability, as members commit to their personal growth journey and support each other in achieving their goals. This collective accountability motivates individuals to stay focused and committed to their development, even when faced with obstacles or setbacks. Ultimately, groups serve as catalysts for transformative learning experiences, empowering individuals to unleash their full potential and thrive in both their personal and professional lives.

In this stage, the group disbands either temporarily or permanently, often following the completion of its goals or the end of a specific project. During adjourning, members may experience a range of emotions, including satisfaction with their accomplishments, nostalgia for the bonds formed within the group, and uncertainty about the future. It's a time for reflection on the group's successes and challenges, as well as an opportunity to celebrate achievements and express gratitude for the contributions of each member.
